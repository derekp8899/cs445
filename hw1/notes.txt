inter arrival time update
  when gen next arrival time , use ... simclock +new arrive - (last arrival)
  last arrival is the arrival time of the patient in the last queue postiion (queue.back().getArrival())
  might result in one extra arrival time added to total inter arrival time when simulation is ended unless we add that to total
   only after an arrival is processed?
   must keep track of total number of arrivals?... that is != to the total number served... update this whenever a new arrive is proessed 

update average # in queue
  weighted average of queue size since last event...
    update before processing any new events but need to use new event time not current sim clock.
    
    
 must update new event timers after each event is processed in the server object.... if arrive = 2 and depart = 1
    after the depart is processed the next arrival time needs to be updated to 2-1 =1.
    must ensure simclock is being updated after each event! or second event will be logged as BEFORE first event.
    
 in process of new arrival 
    if the server status is 0, not busy(pushing into queue size 0)...
        must update the next depature event time it will be set to sentinal value and will always default to a new arrival otherwise
        
length of sim is stored in control
number in queue after sim.. run triage.getQueueLen() after the loop until stop condition has ompleted.

mean service time is --- updated when a departure is processed... total /numberserved upon conclusion of the simulation.
